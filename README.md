## 日本の地震学Pythonライブラリ Libraries for seismology in Japan
Sorry but I will provide these libraries only to direct acquaintance because they are not so sophisticated.  
However if you are interested, please contact me in person or via twitter.  
I may share more information about the library.  
Especially if you are a student of seismology in Japan, I am happy to support your research by sharing my labrary.

公開レベルでないため知人にのみ提供のつもりですが，  
もしも詳細に興味があれば対面かTwitterでご相談ください。  
特に学生の方の場合は，できる限り積極的にライブラリを共有しようと思います。  
いずれもpipでインストールできる状態のファイルです。  

- WINtools  
  <img width="50" alt="wintools" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fbb789a-ff8b-4fe9-97ab-676dac093ede">  
  A library to read/write WIN format data, channel table and files related to hypomh (velocity structure, seis file, etc.).  
	More useful than ObsPy when you read multiple continuous WIN data or use the amplitude information in channel table.
  
- seisdbpy  
  <img width="50" alt="db" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0195d541-a660-4c63-b6ff-6a341d32cb47">
